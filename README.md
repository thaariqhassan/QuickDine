# QuickDine
A restaurant booking app made with ReactJS and MaterialUI

## About
Our project presents a web-based restaurant reservation system aimed at enhancing convenience for customers and streamlining operations for restaurants.

The platform enables users to easily book tables by selecting their preferred restaurant, number of seats, desired time slot, and even pre-order food items to minimize waiting time. A key feature of the system is the real-time view of seating availability, allowing users to make informed decisions while booking. Additionally, the application offers filtering and sorting options based on cuisine type, dietary preferences, and other user-defined criteria, making the reservation experience more personalized.

The system is built using React.js for an interactive frontend, Python FastAPI for a high-performance backend, and MySQL for efficient data storage and management. Through this project, we aim to deliver a seamless, real-time reservation experience that benefits both customers and restaurant operators.
